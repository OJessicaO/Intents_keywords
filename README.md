# Intents_keywords

comb_prog.py uses the Combined Intents files for Intent Classification. Training need not be done again once Intent Cache has been created.
comb_prog.py accesses the training files (provided in combined_intents folder) and prints out the output.

keyword_jiva.py creates a json file with keywords, their frequency under each theme
It reads in a csv file and creates a new json file with the output. keyword_inte is the same code with commenting.
