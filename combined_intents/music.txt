Not even the Beatles could write songs everyone liked
The score is horrible! 
a combination of boring instruments with cheesy 80's tunes?
The music was annoyingly movie-of-the-week quality.
The heartbeat sounds used are a great effect.
There's also a three minute banjo solo that shows off Bostwick's skill behind the instrument.
a decent music score. so terrible music score.
horrible music. dreadful music.
the soundtrack is haphazard.
The musical score consists of four instruments doing irritating atonal jazz riffs.
some overly grandiose music.
a mix of "period" music and wailing electric guitars during the "rumble" scenes.
I think this is one of the worst musical scores I've ever heard.
The soundtrack.. wow. 
I think this is one of the worst musical scores I've ever heard. What awful guitar solos, my god. The soundtrack though, isn't to bad.
some coo soundtrack songs.
The music and background noise completely overpower the dialogue.
The sound track was off by about 10 seconds.
