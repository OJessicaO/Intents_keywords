ambiance is awesome and well conceptualised
The ambience is so so 
the pics on Zomato by the management are deceptive make it look much larger and plush than it actually is. 
The light effects are simply amazing and a treat to the eyes.
The place is small but cosy the dance floor section is tiny.
Chilled out place location and space inside are definitely pluses
But the place is fabulous and the ambiance is excellent
Music was a downer
Ambience wise also it s good.

The place was dead with very few guests.
Ambience 4 5
The dance floor is big but it was very very crowded maybe because of a saturday.
The ambiance gives a very family vibe and the patisserie display just adds to the charm.
They play Bollywood songs on Saturday night.
It was a bollywood night and the dj was superb. One of the best dance floors I have been to.
it becomes only about the food and not the dining experience.
The restaurant is well made and very welcoming nice graphic design and branding.
The ambiance is nice and good concept of sitting by the pond that they have with fish in them specially in night when all the lights are on it looks amazing
